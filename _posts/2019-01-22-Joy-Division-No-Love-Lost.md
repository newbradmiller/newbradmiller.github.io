No love lost, the saying or phrase initially brings up feelings of dislike, animosity and hatred, this is the common understanding of the term but I thought about it more and feel that truthfully the term is misused and misunderstood.  No love lost means to me that if there ever was love that existed it will always exist in one form or another.  

On the other hand I often wish it were true, that love could be lost forever into a cosmic black hole of no return.  Because there are some loves that have a way of making your soul sick.
