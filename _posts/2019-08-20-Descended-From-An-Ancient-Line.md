Happy the Man, and happy he alone,  
He, who can call to day his own:  
He who, secure within, can say,  
To morrow do thy worst, for I have liv’d to-day.  
Be fair, or foul, or rain, or shine,  
The joys I have possest, in spight of fate, are mine.  
Not Heav’n it self upon the past has pow’r;  
But what has been, has been, and I have had my hour.  
  
Fortune, that with malicious joy  
Does Man her slave oppress,  
Proud of her Office to destory,  
Is seldome pleas’d to bless:  
Still various, and unconstant still,  
But with an inclination to be ill.  
Promotes, degrades, delights in strife,  
And makes a Lottery of life.  
I can enjoy her while she’s kind;  
But when she dances in the wind,  
And shakes the wings, and will not stay,  
I puff the Prostitute away:  
The little or the much she gave, is quietly resign’d:  
Content with poverty, my Soul I arm;  
And Vertue, tho’ in rags, will keep me warm.  
  
What is’t to me,  
Who never sail in her unfaithful Sea,  
If Storms arise, and Clouds grow black;  
If the Mast split, and threaten wreck?  
Then let the greedy Merchant fear  
For his ill gotten gain;  
And pray to Gods that will not hear,  
While the debating winds and billows bear  
His Wealth into the Main  
For me, secure from Fortunes blows  
(Secure of what I cannot lose,)  
In my small Pinnace I can sail,  
Contemning all the blustring roar;  
And running with a merry gale,  
With friendly Stars my safety seek  
Within some little winding Creek;  
And see the storm a shore.
