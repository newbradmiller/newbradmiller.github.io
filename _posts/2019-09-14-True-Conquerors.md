>Old farmers, travellers, workmen (no matter
>how crippled or bent),
>Old sailors, out of many a perilous voyage,
>storm and wreck,
>Old soldiers from campaigns, with all their
>wounds, defeats and scars;
>Enough that they've survived it all—long life's
>unflinching ones!
>Forth from their struggles, trials, fights, to have
>emerged at all—in that alone,
>True conquerors of life o'er all the rest.

*-Walt Whitman*
