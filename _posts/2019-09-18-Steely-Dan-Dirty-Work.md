*I was going to post 'Rikki Don't Lose That Number' but I like this song better and it popped up in my playlist.  Reminds me of pornography, which I have never done personally, but for one reason or another, that is what the song reminds me, that dirty fucking business.  It had a grip on me at one time, from an end-user standpoint, still fucked up from it to be honest.  That is what the song reminds me of, I wonder what they wrote it about?  Will have to look into that, maybe another time.*
