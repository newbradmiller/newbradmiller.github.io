*Here is another song that reminds me of pornography, well the bandname anyways, but I really like the song, it happened to be in my playlist, must be some latent mind frames.  Butthole Surfers, I was not surfing for buttholes, lol.  Straight and legal pornography but when you see enough of it, it does a little damage to your psyche.  Anyhow, I am posting the song because I like the song and the band and I am trying to exorcise this shit which has proven to be difficult for sometime and posting the song helps me somehow.*
