No cigarettes until September likely, since I have taken to not bumming them off people, mostly because people on the street are cheap and put half smoked cigarettes back in their packs which ruins the entire pack, or they smoke Newports, or some other off-brand of stale tobacco.  The last pack I smoked was half awful too, but the other half I miss.
