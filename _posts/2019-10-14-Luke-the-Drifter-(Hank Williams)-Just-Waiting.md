*I heard this on the radio and it made me feel like my life wasn't so different from everybody else's, we are all just waitin' for something (death mostly), but if we are fortunate enough we have much waiting to do in between our births and the big D.  I can dig on Hank Williams though, its easy listening, and often sage wisdom.*
