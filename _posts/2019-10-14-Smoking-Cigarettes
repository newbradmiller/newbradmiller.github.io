A day after I wrote the last post I bummed a cigarette, but for the most part I didn't ask too many people too often and was happy to get to the 5th to buy my own pack.  I thpought I'd save a few bucks on a pack of Pall Mall Orange (Ultra Lights), they weren't any damn cheaper but not that bad of a smoke, and I smoked the whole pack in a day.  Back to Marlboro Gold and back to being broke, so back to avoiding the one-off smoke from the strangers on the street.
