Playing this as I curse everybody out loud at the library for talking over my conscious thought, which they do at their fucking liberty all day every day, I like to tell them to fuck off every chance I get.  I don't want this space to become an outlet for my sanity, but if I could explain to you all the mental and emotional stessors I am forced to deal with everyday of my life, well, I would, and if I could you too would understand what and why I am in the position I am in today.  

The world has continued to put pressure on me to participate in ways that I don't care to participate in, my conscious relatity does not agree with my world view and speaks vocally to me every chance it gets, its a constant fucking battle between every walking slag on the street and myself, and I am ready to go to a new world.  I hate most everybody in the most friendly way if you can imagine that but I do wish they'd all go fuck themselves, especially the blacks and the mexicans.  

This song is pretty upbeat though, made me happier, so I thought I'd play it for you.
