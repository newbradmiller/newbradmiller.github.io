*playing this as I curse everybody out loud at the library for talking over my conscious thought, which they do at their fucking liberty all day every day, because they are apparently somehow superior (which I don't believe) I mostly tell them to fuck off every chance I get.  This song is pretty upbeat though, made me happier, so I play it for you.
