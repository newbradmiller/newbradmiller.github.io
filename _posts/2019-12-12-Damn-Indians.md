Running the damn leaf blowers every morning, knocking on the damn wood and iron, messing with my chakras, pushing me around like a bag in the wind.  Pisses me off, so while I'm thankful for the Indian spirit, I sometimes think they are out to scalp me too, not sure why, I live a pretty simple life here on the planet, eat vegan, recycle, walk everywhere, but my carbon credits are piling up, maybe I should burn them all driving the big rig for the machine?  I guess what I'm saying is while I'm thankful for my Indian spirit, I'm also thankful for my own spirit which has been derived from my personal experiences here on the planet.  My family, my past, my failures, my successes, my peace, my indignance.
