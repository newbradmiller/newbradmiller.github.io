First post of the new year and its nice, I can see everything, like a new pair of glasses without any scratches.  I see myself going to get beer, I see myself possibly getting a burrito, a trip to the 99 cent store, maybe another movie?  Life is no different though, just another day, another year, same people in the same places, same vibrations, same angst, same suffering, same happiness.  Library still urks me, everytime I try to write on the computer I am faced with the forces that don't want me to write on the computer, the vibration of cream cheese.  And tomorrow I'll probably have a bagel with a smear because while I like to smear cheese I do eat it on occassion.  Anyways, here is 2020, may it be a good year, may we all thrive and survive.
